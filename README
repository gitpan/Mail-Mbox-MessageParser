Mail::Mbox::MessageParser - A fast and simple mbox folder reader

Mail::Mbox::MessageParser is a feature-poor but very fast mbox parser. It uses
the best of three strategies for parsing a mailbox: either using cached folder
information, GNU grep, or highly optimized Perl.

New in version 1.00:
- This is the initial version. The code is based on a previou version that was
  part of the grepmail package.


DEPENDENCIES

- Storable: required if you want to use caching
- GNU grep(1): required if you want to use grep support

The modules can be found here:

Storable:                  http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Storable

Installation can also be done automatically using the CPAN module:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Storable'


INSTALLATION

=> On Non-Windows systems:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

The "perl Makefile.PL" command will prompt you for an installation location if
you run it interactively, and will use the default values if it is run
non-iteractively. You can force it to run non-interactively by specifying
either "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
"INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories), or
"INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

If make test fails, please see the INSTALLATION PROBLEMS section below.


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email, to the address below, the
*.testoutput and *.testoutput.diff files for the test, which are located in
t/temp.

For other bugs, see the section REPORTING BUGS below.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man Mail::Mbox::MessageParser". If you are interested in the
Cache, Grep, or Perl implementations, you can do the same for
Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Cache, Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Grep. and
Mail::Mbox::MessageParser::Perl

REPORTING BUGS

You can report bugs by sending email to david@coppit.org. Please attach the
output files noted above. If the bug is related to processing of a particular
mailbox, try to trim the mailbox to the smallest set of emails that still
exhibit the problem.  Then use the "anonymize_mailbox" program that comes with
the distribution to remove any sensitive information, and attach the mailbox
to the bug report.
